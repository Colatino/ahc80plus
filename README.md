# The library

This is a simple Python library that uses PySerial to read temperatures (dry and wet bulbs) and relative humidity from a [FullGauge AHC 80 plus](https://www.fullgauge.com.br/produto-ahc-80-plus) controller.

**Instalation**

Just copy the [library](./ahc80plus.py) to your project folder

*Usage*
```python
  from ahc80plus import AHC80plus
  
  # AHC80plus(address,serial_port,timeout_s)
  ahc80=AHC80plus(1,'COM3',1)
  ahc80.read()
  print("Dry temperature",ahc80.t_dry,'째C')
  print("Wet temperature",ahc80.t_wet,'째C')
  print("Relative Humidity",ahc80.r_h,'%')
```
*Output*
```
   Dry temperature 27.1 째C
   Wet temperature 26.8 째C
   Relative Humidity 97.0 %
```

# FullGauge AHC 80 plus

FullGauge's AHC 80 plus is a relative humidity controller based on the principle of [Psychrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychrometrics). Very useful if you want to monitor and control the conditions of a high moisture content room, like a concrete sample curing room, where electronic humidity sensors just won't work reliably or are very expensive due to condensation.

# Dependencies
This code depends on the [PySerial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) library
